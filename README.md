# Secure IoT Communication: Implementing Authentication, Encryption and Integrity on ESP32

This project explores the implementation of an IoT system using the ESP32 microcontroller with a focus on secure data transmission and basic functionalities. The ESP32 is integrated with a DHT11 sensor to collect temperature and humidity data, which is transmitted to a server using the MQTT protocol. To ensure secure communication, the project employs robust authentication, data integrity, and encryption mechanisms, including HMAC-based integrity checks with keys securely stored in Non-Volatile Storage (NVS). The system design adheres to secure design principles while considering the computational limitations of IoT devices. Additionally, the integration with Node-RED provides graphical visualization of sensor data, enhancing user accessibility and interaction.
